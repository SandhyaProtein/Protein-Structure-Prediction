# Protein-Structure-Prediction
Coarse structure prediction using Hydrophobic-Polar model. Use of GPU computing through OpenCL framework.
Different set of tool for PSP using HP model ia available at http://www.abinitio-hp-psp.com/.
If you are using this code, please cite paper title "Ab Initio protein structure prediction using GPU computing".
